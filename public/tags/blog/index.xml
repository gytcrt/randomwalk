      <description>&lt;p&gt;I chose &amp;ldquo;Random Walk&amp;rdquo; as the name of my website, as both a representation of my work and personal interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Randomness is prominent in the fields of modern statistical theory, machine learning, and AI (Deep Learning). In recent years, the unpredictability of the Large Language Model(LLM) has presented a  major challenge for companies and individuals looking to adopt the latest AI in their business and daily life. However, I think randomness brings a lot of opportunities and beauty to the world, too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Randomness is prominent in the fields of modern statistical theory, machine learning, and AI (Deep Learning). In recent years, the unpredictability of the Large Language Model(LLM) has presented a  major challenge for companies and individuals looking to adopt the latest AI in their business and daily life. However, I think randomness brings a lot of opportunities and beauty to the world, too.</p>
<p>An example of this is my own process of debugging a technical issue: sometimes, I may think of a few potential solutions, but I don&rsquo;t yet know which one is optimal. I might randomly proceed with one of the ideas if they all look viable to me. If it doesn&rsquo;t work, I would roll back to the previous version and try another approach. Random seeds(np.random.seed(1234)ðŸ˜‰) or random experiments can lead to solutions and innovations.</p>
<p>When I was a teenager, I was fascinated by {{&lt; newtabref href=&ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Luis_Borges%22">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Luis_Borges&quot;</a> title=&ldquo;Jorge Luis Borges&rdquo; &gt;}}&rsquo;s short novel {{&lt; newtabref href=&ldquo;<a href="https://mycours.es/gamedesign2012/files/2012/08/The-Garden-of-Forking-Paths-Jorge-Luis-Borges-1941.pdf%22">https://mycours.es/gamedesign2012/files/2012/08/The-Garden-of-Forking-Paths-Jorge-Luis-Borges-1941.pdf&quot;</a> title=&ldquo;The Garden of Forking Paths&rdquo; &gt;}}. The novel is very mysterious, multidimensional, and intriguing. It visualizes our life (or world) as a giant labyrinth; whenever we make a decision, it leads to one of life&rsquo;s paths. In a way, it&rsquo;s similar to Github forking and branching. Do all paths converge to the same global optimal like random walk in {{&lt; newtabref href=&ldquo;<a href="https://people.duke.edu/~ccc14/sta-663/mcmc.html%22">https://people.duke.edu/~ccc14/sta-663/mcmc.html&quot;</a> title=&ldquo;Markov chain Monte Carlo method&rdquo; &gt;}}?
