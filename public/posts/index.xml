      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;why&#34;&gt;Why?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was in graduate school, I set up a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gytcrt/gytcrt.github.io&#34;&gt;personal blog&lt;/a&gt; to show case my project and share thoughts. I&amp;rsquo;ve planned to keep developing that site but it has taken a back seat ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have got more time lately and decided to pick up this project. It turned out to be so much fun, and I want to share how I have re-built this website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;choose-domain-name-and-domain-registrar&#34;&gt;Choose domain name and domain registrar&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choosing a domain name is like choosing a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.shopify.com/blog/domain-seo?term=&amp;amp;adid=647967866337&amp;amp;campaignid=19683492884&amp;amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;amp;utm_source=google&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwwqfABhBcEiwAZJjC3poWT02q2-7_BJRlCqsvGTnMw5UM1d8tee_OgW0UnffVvSXugolTdBoClrwQAvD_BwE#&#34;&gt;brand name&lt;/a&gt; for your website. Luckily, I don&amp;rsquo;t share name with some celebrities. I was able to register for andreagao.com in 2017 via Google Domain. I generally had a good experience with Google Domain. But unfortunately, they have been &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/16/23763340/google-domains-sunset-sell-squarespace&#34;&gt;acquired by Squarespace&lt;/a&gt;. So I had to find another domain registrar.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

So I had to find another domain registrar.</p>
<p>I quoted on both <a href="https://aboutus.godaddy.net/about-us/overview/default.aspx">GoDaddy</a> and <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap</a>, and figured the price on Namecheap is more sensible to me. From usability standpoint, I think Namecheap is not different from Google Domain.</p>

If you are thinking about getting a domain, you can consider the advice from the thread too.</p>

<p>There are millions of ways to build a personal website in 2025. If you want to be relieved from coding and deploying front-end, <a href="https://www.wix.com/">Wix</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.com/">Wordpress</a> and <a href="https://www.squarespace.com/">Squarespace</a> are all classic options.

      <title>A Random Walk</title>
      <link>http://localhost:49602/posts/random-walk/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I chose &amp;ldquo;Random Walk&amp;rdquo; as the name of my website, as both a representation of my work and personal interests .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Randomness is prominent in the fields of modern statistical theory, machine learning, and AI (Deep Learning). In recent years, the unpredictability of the Large Language Model(LLM) has presented a  major challenge for companies and individuals looking to adopt the latest AI in their business and daily life. However, I think randomness brings a lot of opportunities and beauty to the world, too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Randomness is prominent in the fields of modern statistical theory, machine learning, and AI (Deep Learning). In recent years, the unpredictability of the Large Language Model(LLM) has presented a  major challenge for companies and individuals looking to adopt the latest AI in their business and daily life. However, I think randomness brings a lot of opportunities and beauty to the world, too.</p>
<p>An example of this is my own process of debugging a technical issue: sometimes, I may think of a few potential solutions, but I don‚Äôt yet know which one is optimal. I might randomly proceed with one of the ideas if they all look viable to me. If it doesn‚Äôt work, I would roll back to the previous version and try another approach. Random seeds(np.random.seed(1234)üòâ) or random experiments can lead to solutions and innovations.</p>
<p>When I was a teenager, I was fascinated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Luis_Borges">Jorge Luis Borges</a>‚Äôs short novel <a href="https://mycours.es/gamedesign2012/files/2012/08/The-Garden-of-Forking-Paths-Jorge-Luis-Borges-1941.pdf">The Garden of Forking Paths</a>. The novel is very mysterious, multidimensional, and intriguing. It visualizes our life (or world) as a giant labyrinth; whenever we make a decision, it leads to one of life‚Äôs paths. In a way, it‚Äôs similar to Github forking and branching. Do all paths converge to the same global optimal like random walk in <a href="https://people.duke.edu/~ccc14/sta-663/mcmc.html">Markov chain Monte Carlo method</a>? Or is my existence and selfhood only one of many  in an infinite number of universes?</p>

<p>I appreciate the ways in which theory, engineering, and art converge upon ‚ÄúRandom Walk.‚Äù I hope you enjoy a short walk on my site.</p>
