      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building a personal website in 2025 has become significantly easier with modern tools and AI assistance. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll share my experience rebuilding my personal website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why&#34;&gt;Why?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was in graduate school, I set up a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gytcrt/gytcrt.github.io&#34;&gt;personal blog&lt;/a&gt; to show case my project and share thoughts. I&amp;rsquo;ve planned to keep developing that site but it has taken a back seat ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have got more time lately and decided to pick up this project. It turned out to be so much fun, and I want to share how I have re-built this website.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Building a personal website in 2025 has become significantly easier with modern tools and AI assistance. In this post, I&rsquo;ll share my experience rebuilding my personal website.</p>
<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>When I was in graduate school, I set up a <a href="https://github.com/gytcrt/gytcrt.github.io">personal blog</a> to show case my project and share thoughts. I&rsquo;ve planned to keep developing that site but it has taken a back seat ever since.</p>
<p>I have got more time lately and decided to pick up this project. It turned out to be so much fun, and I want to share how I have re-built this website.</p>
<h2 id="choose-domain-name-and-domain-registrar">Choose domain name and domain registrar</h2>
<p>Choosing a domain name is like choosing a <a href="https://www.shopify.com/blog/domain-seo?term=&amp;adid=647967866337&amp;campaignid=19683492884&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_source=google&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwwqfABhBcEiwAZJjC3poWT02q2-7_BJRlCqsvGTnMw5UM1d8tee_OgW0UnffVvSXugolTdBoClrwQAvD_BwE#">brand name</a> for your website. Luckily, I don&rsquo;t share name with some celebrities. I was able to register for andreagao.com in 2017 via Google Domain. I generally had a good experience with Google Domain. But unfortunately, they have been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/16/23763340/google-domains-sunset-sell-squarespace">acquired by Squarespace</a>. So I had to find another domain registrar.</p>
<p>I quoted on both <a href="https://aboutus.godaddy.net/about-us/overview/default.aspx">GoDaddy</a> and <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap</a>, and figured the price on Namecheap is more sensible to me. From usability standpoint, I think Namecheap is not different from Google Domain.</p>
<p>There is a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1bjfqse/whats_the_best_domain_registrar_in_2024/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">reddit thread</a> about the best domain registrar in 2024. If you are thinking about getting a domain, you can consider the advice from the thread too.</p>
<h2 id="framework-selection">Framework selection</h2>
<p>There are millions of ways to build a personal website in 2025. If you want to be relieved from coding and deploying front-end, <a href="https://www.wix.com/">Wix</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.com/">Wordpress</a> and <a href="https://www.squarespace.com/">Squarespace</a> are all classic options. Or you can consider GenAI website builder like <a href="https://replit.com/">replit</a> too.</p>
<p>I decided to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator">static website builder</a>, since I want to code more and have more control over my website. Similar to no-code option in last paragraph, there are many static website builder frameworks too. <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> and <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> are the most popular ones. Comparing to Jekyll, Hugo is relatively younger and way faster than Jekyll. I have used Jekyll to build my previous website, so I thought exploring Hugo would be interesting. For anyone who wants to try static website builder, I&rsquo;d recommend both of them. There are a lot of templates and resources available online for both of them. You cannot go wrong either way.</p>
<p>Both Hugo and Jekyll provide a lot of themes(like PPT template) for you to build upon. Here are two good resources to find a theme for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jekyll themes: <a href="https://jekyllthemes.io/jekyll-portfolio-themes">https://jekyllthemes.io/jekyll-portfolio-themes</a></li>
<li>Hugo themes: <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/tags/blog/">https://themes.gohugo.io/tags/blog/</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>I also found it very helpful to browse other people&rsquo;s websites created from the themes.</strong> Some of them serve as a great inspiration for me, and many folks wrote blogs about their website set-up and customization too. I will link some reference at the end of this post.</p>
<p>After browsing 100+ websites, I picked <a href="https://reorx.github.io/hugo-PaperModX/">PaperModX</a> to start my website. PaperModX is an enhanced version of <a href="https://adityatelange.github.io/hugo-PaperMod/">PaperMod</a>. I like the clean aesthetic of the theme, and it is the <a href="https://github.com/QIN2DIM/awesome-hugo-themes">top stared GitHub theme</a> for Hugo. Similar to other design choice in software development, Choosing a popular framework with a mature community makes your life easier.</p>
<h2 id="hosting-and-deployment-github-pages--github-actions">Hosting and deployment: Github Pages + Github Actions</h2>
<p>Since I&rsquo;m building a static website, which doesn&rsquo;t contain dynamic content. The best and most economic place to host my website is <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github pages</a>. It is free if you are using public repo or some premium version of Github account.</p>
<p>In addition, <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">Github Actions</a> has made deployment so easy along with Github Page. Hugo has a page on <a href="https://gohugo.io/host-and-deploy/host-on-github-pages/">hosting on Github Pages with Github Actions</a>. I recommend following the page to deploy your static website.</p>
<p>If you are not familiar with deployment or CI/CD tools like Github Actions, don&rsquo;t get scared by it. With Github Copilot and AI coding tools like Cursor, configuring the deployment files has been way easier than it used to be.</p>
<h2 id="analytics-set-up-umami--digitalocean">Analytics set up: Umami + DigitalOcean</h2>
<p>In modern product/software development, feedback is essential for improvement. My website aims to serve myself and my audience, so I&rsquo;d love to take feedback from my audience. There are direct and indirect feedbacks. Website traffic is in direct feedback, and comments from visitor are direct feedback. In this section, I will talk about my analytics platform set up(indirect feedback).</p>
<p>Hugo PaperMod provides very easy integration with <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10089681?hl=en">Google Analytics 4</a>. I believe using Google Analytics would be the most straight forward and time-saving set up. However, I do want to have more control over my traffic data, and I did more research on potential analytics tools.
<a href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible Analytics</a> and <a href="https://umami.is/">Umami</a> are two of the popular tools. I picked Umami since it&rsquo;s open-source, free and self-hostable.</p>
<p>As for hosting, I prefer minimal set up and effort for Umami, since it&rsquo;s an internal tool for my website and I don&rsquo;t have billions of visitors. I chose DigitalOcean to host my Umami server and managed database. DitialOcean provides very <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-umami-web-analytics-software-on-ubuntu-20-04">detailed tutorial</a> on setting up Umami on its Ubuntu machine. I found it almost effortless to set Umami on DigitalOcean.</p>
<h2 id="vibe-coding-and-advice">Vibe coding and advice</h2>
<p>I majored in mathematics and statistics in college and graduate school, and my major programming languages are Matlab and R. When I built my first website with Python and Jekyll, it was challenging to pick up a new framework by myself.</p>
<p>When it comes to AI tools for coding, I&rsquo;m so grateful of having them in 2025. Vibe/AI coding tools plus LLM have made solo web development experience easier this time.</p>

      <title>A Random Walk</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/random-walk/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I chose &amp;ldquo;Random Walk&amp;rdquo; as the name of my website, as both a representation of my work and personal interests .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Randomness is prominent in the fields of modern statistical theory, machine learning, and AI (Deep Learning). In recent years, the unpredictability of the Large Language Model(LLM) has presented a  major challenge for companies and individuals looking to adopt the latest AI in their business and daily life. However, I think randomness brings a lot of opportunities and beauty to the world, too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Randomness is prominent in the fields of modern statistical theory, machine learning, and AI (Deep Learning). In recent years, the unpredictability of the Large Language Model(LLM) has presented a  major challenge for companies and individuals looking to adopt the latest AI in their business and daily life. However, I think randomness brings a lot of opportunities and beauty to the world, too.</p>
<p>An example of this is my own process of debugging a technical issue: sometimes, I may think of a few potential solutions, but I don’t yet know which one is optimal. I might randomly proceed with one of the ideas if they all look viable to me. If it doesn’t work, I would roll back to the previous version and try another approach. Random seeds(np.random.seed(1234)😉) or random experiments can lead to solutions and innovations.</p>
<p>When I was a teenager, I was fascinated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Luis_Borges">Jorge Luis Borges</a>’s short novel <a href="https://mycours.es/gamedesign2012/files/2012/08/The-Garden-of-Forking-Paths-Jorge-Luis-Borges-1941.pdf">The Garden of Forking Paths</a>. The novel is very mysterious, multidimensional, and intriguing. It visualizes our life (or world) as a giant labyrinth; whenever we make a decision, it leads to one of life’s paths. In a way, it’s similar to Github forking and branching. Do all paths converge to the same global optimal like random walk in <a href="https://people.duke.edu/~ccc14/sta-663/mcmc.html">Markov chain Monte Carlo method</a>? Or is my existence and selfhood only one of many  in an infinite number of universes?</p>

<p>I appreciate the ways in which theory, engineering, and art converge upon “Random Walk.” I hope you enjoy a short walk on my site.</p>
