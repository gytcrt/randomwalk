![Andrea Gao](/images/profile.jpg)

My name is Andrea Gao (she/her). I am a full-stack AI practitioner. 

My interest is to use data and ML/AI system together to solve valuable problems. I have particularly focused on developing GenAI use cases and iterating on it in last 2 years. 

I have worked on every components in modern ML/AI system from proof-of-concept to pilot to production as an engineer and a leader. I found it thrilling to innovate and change the status with status of art technology. 

As I stepped into leadership role, I found myself a bit rusty in coding recent years. So I decided to re-build my personal website to be closer to latest tools and frameworks. I believe itâ€™s important for leaders to stay close to their domain when they guide their team and organization.
