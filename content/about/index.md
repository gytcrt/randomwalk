![Andrea Gao](/images/profile.jpg)

My name is Andrea Gao (she/her). I am a full-stack AI practitioner.

My interest is in using data and ML/AI systems together to solve valuable problems. I have particularly focused on developing GenAI use cases and iterating on them in the last 2 years.

I have worked on every step in modern ML/AI systems, from proof-of-concept to pilot to production, as both an engineer and a leader. I find it thrilling to innovate and change the status quo with cutting-edge or mature technologies.

As I stepped into leadership roles, I found myself a bit rusty in coding in recent years. So I decided to rebuild my personal website to get closer to the latest tools and frameworks. I believe itâ€™s important for leaders to stay close to their domain when they guide their team and organization.
