I’m Andrea Gao (she/her), a startup founder based in NYC.

I spent most of my career helping organizations turn data into better decisions. As my work has increasingly focused on applying LLMs and GenAI to transform businesses’ daily operations, I believe AI is more than hype. My current venture is building AI-native solutions that work outside of demos and benefit both people and businesses. 

I love writing, which serves as a medium to present intriguing problems or shed light on unspeakable feelings.

In my spare time, I'm also a big movie fan - a regular at the New York Film Festival and independent movie theaters.
