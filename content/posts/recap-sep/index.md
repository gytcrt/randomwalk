## Good news
September has been a busy month for me, and I have been happily occupied by the changes in life:

- I got married to my partner 💍🤵🏻
- I am starting my own business with a friend 📈🪙
- We are resolving uncertainty around my immigration situation 🇺🇸🛂

With what has happened and is happening, I haven't had a chance to sit down and write a regular blog post for September. But I want to briefly jot them down here so that people who care about me and I can revisit this post in future :)

## What bothers me

Guess what could go wrong in such a lovely month? *My AI coding assistant.* 

Below is a screenshot of a code snippet generated by ChatGPT when I tried to pick up an unfamiliar package. The function `expected_freqtrade_path` makes zero sense, though I found it very funny.

Well, I think the boundaries and ways of working between human and AI are actively evolving. I also look forward to seeing how I react to this part of the blog in 5, 10, 20 years.  

Cheers🥂
