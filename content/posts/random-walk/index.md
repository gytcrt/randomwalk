I chose "Random Walk" as the name of my website, since I want it to represent my work and personal interest. 

In modern statistical theory, machine learning and AI(Deep Learning) fields, randomness is prominent. In recent years, unpredictability of Large Language Model has been a major challenge for companies and individuals to adopt latest AI in their business and daily life. However, I think randomness brings a lot of opportunities and beauty to the world too.  

Sometimes when debugging a technical issue, I might have a few ideas of potential solutions but I don‚Äôt know which one is optimal. I might randomly proceed with one of ideas if they all look viable to me. If it doesn‚Äôt work, I would roll back to previous version and try another approach. Random seeds(np.random.seed(1234)üòâ) or random experiments can lead to solutions and innovations.

When I was a teenage, I was fascinated by [Jorge Luis Borges‚Äôs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Luis_Borges) short novel [The Garden of Forking Paths](https://mycours.es/gamedesign2012/files/2012/08/The-Garden-of-Forking-Paths-Jorge-Luis-Borges-1941.pdf). The novel is very mysterious, multidimensional and intriguing. It visualizes our life (or world) as a giant labyrinth, whenever we make a decision, it leads to one of life paths. Do all paths converge to the same global optimal like random walk in [Markov chain Monte Carlo method](https://people.duke.edu/~ccc14/sta-663/mcmc.html)? Or is I only 1 of my-selves in infinite number of universes?  

I like that theory, engineering, and art converge upon ‚ÄúRandom Walk‚Äù. And I hope you enjoy a short walk on my site.
