I chose "Random Walk" as the name of my website, as both a representation of my work and personal interests .

Randomness is prominent in the fields of modern statistical theory, machine learning, and AI (Deep Learning). In recent years, the unpredictability of the Large Language Model(LLM) has presented a  major challenge for companies and individuals looking to adopt the latest AI in their business and daily life. However, I think randomness brings a lot of opportunities and beauty to the world, too.  

An example of this is my own process of debugging a technical issue: sometimes, I may think of a few potential solutions, but I don‚Äôt yet know which one is optimal l. I might randomly proceed with one of the ideas if they all look viable to me. If it doesn‚Äôt work, I would roll back to the previous version and try another approach. Random seeds(np.random.seed(1234)üòâ) or random experiments can lead to solutions and innovations.

When I was a teenager, I was fascinated by Jorge Luis Borges‚Äôs short novel [The Garden of Forking Paths](https://mycours.es/gamedesign2012/files/2012/08/The-Garden-of-Forking-Paths-Jorge-Luis-Borges-1941.pdf). The novel is very mysterious, multidimensional, and intriguing. It visualizes our life (or world) as a giant labyrinth; whenever we make a decision, it leads to one of life‚Äôs paths. In a way, it‚Äôs similar to Github forking and branching. Do all paths converge to the same global optimal like random walk in [Markov chain Monte Carlo method](https://people.duke.edu/~ccc14/sta-663/mcmc.html)? Or is my existence and selfhood only one of many  in an infinite number of universes?

I appreciate the ways in which theory, engineering, and art converge upon ‚ÄúRandom Walk.‚Äù I hope you enjoy a short walk on my site.
