I chose "Random Walk" as the name of my website, since I want to represent my work and interest with the name. 

In modern statistical theroy, machine learning and AI(Deep Learning) fields, randomness is prominent. Throughout my university time and my career, I set a seed number to manage randomization in R program and assigned random weights to initialize a neural network model in Python. In recent years, unpredictability of Large Language Model has been a major challenge for companies and individueals to adopt latest AI in their business and daily life.
