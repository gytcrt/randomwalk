## TL;DR

## Stack overflow WAS essential for coders

As someone starting coding in the 2010s, Stack Overflow was my best buddy. When I just started my career as a data scientist, 50% of my coding skills were learned from working itself, 30% were from Stack Overflow, and 20% were from university or structured courses. I don’t remember how many times I encountered a configuration issue and it subsequently led to a Stack Overflow rabbit hole journey for hours – especially early in my career.

Stack Overflow was the essential website for whoever codes or wants to code in the last 10-15 years. However, [Stack Overflow is almost dead](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/stack-overflow-is-almost-dead/) at this point for a few reasons:

- **The advent of LLMs**: nowadays, coders can easily ask LLMs like ChatGPT or Gemini to debug most issues. I personally have not used Stack Overflow for debugging anymore. The number of questions asked on Stack Overflow has dropped sharply after ChatGPT’s launch at the end of 2022.

- **Rigid Moderation**: Stack Overflow has incredibly rigid moderation, which has led to bad user experience. [Many users complained about the difficulty of updating their own answers or asking similar questions on Stack Overflow](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41364798). Significant number of solved questions are over 5 years old. Although, technical packages and frameworks are constantly updated and 5 years are forever in the modern technology universe.

- **Toxic community**: Stack Overflow has been an unfriendly place to users (especially new users). Although the vibe varies across sub-communities on Stack Overflow, the comment section can be hostile and dismissive.

I don’t remember when was the last time I fixed a bug via Stack Overflow, but I feel nostalgic about it already. LLMs and AI coding tools have changed my coding workflow, but they are not the key to all coding solutions.

## New bugs are uncharted areas for AI companies
