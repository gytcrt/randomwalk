# Why?
When I was in graduate school, I set up a [personal blog](https://github.com/gytcrt/gytcrt.github.io) to show case my project and share thoughts. I've planned to keep developing that site but it has taken a back seat ever since. 

I have got more time lately and decided to pick up this project. It turned out to be so much fun, and I want to share how I have re-built this website.

# Choose domain name and domain registrar
Choosing a domain name is like choosing a [brand name](https://www.shopify.com/blog/domain-seo?term=&adid=647967866337&campaignid=19683492884&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwwqfABhBcEiwAZJjC3poWT02q2-7_BJRlCqsvGTnMw5UM1d8tee_OgW0UnffVvSXugolTdBoClrwQAvD_BwE#) for your website. Luckily, I don't share name with some celebrities. I was able to register for andreagao.com in 2017 via Google Domain. I generally had a good experience with Google Domain. But unfortunately, they have been [acquired by Squarespace](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/16/23763340/google-domains-sunset-sell-squarespace). So I had to find another domain registrar.

I quoted on both [GoDaddy](https://aboutus.godaddy.net/about-us/overview/default.aspx) and [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/), and figured the price on Namecheap is more sensible to me. From usability standpoint, I think Namecheap is not different from Google Domain. 

There is a [reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1bjfqse/whats_the_best_domain_registrar_in_2024/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) about the best domain registrar in 2024. If you are thinking about getting a domain, you can consider the advice from the thread too. 

# Framework selection
There are millions of ways to build a personal website in 2025. If you want to be relieved from coding and deploying front-end, [Wix](https://www.wix.com/), [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/) and [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/) are all classic options. Or you can consider GenAI website builder like [replit](https://replit.com/) too. 

I decided to
