In 2025, I experienced a few life events that required me to request government services at both the federal and state levels. Some of the experience was a jaw-dropping journey, which I would call Kafkaesque customer service. If you continue reading, you will find my story both surreal and realistic.

Three months ago, I requested a service from the NY state government online. I subsequently received four to five letters in my mailbox, three of which required more information from me. I filled out the requisite forms, collected, printed, and attached all my supporting documents, and mailed them out one by one within a few days. After providing all the information, I heard nothing from the state government via mail or online portal for the next two months. My worries grew over time.

In January 2026, I started reaching out to the state government by calling the customer service number on their website and submitting an inquiry through their online message portal. After several attempts at contacting the government agency, I realized I could not get hold of an agent on the phone; the customer service line did not even allow me to wait in line for an agent. Instead, their IVR system just hung up on me after a couple of minutes without any explanation. As for submitting an online inquiry, after I drafted and submitted a message on the government portal, the portal didn’t even return a confirmation email or reference number, meaning I couldn't track it or prove the inquiry was ever submitted. Besides the user-unfriendly experience and confusing design of the state government website, the customer service experience made me more unsettled.

Unsurprisingly, nothing changed after my inquiry in January; I was still waiting for an update or follow-up from the state government on my case as the calendar turned to February. After consulting ChatGPT, I decided to pursue an escalation by writing to my NY state assemblymember. On February 3rd, I contacted my assemblymember, Robert Carroll, through his online form, in which I detailed my situation and struggle with the state government. Within hours that same day, a staff member from my assemblymember’s office replied to me via email and confirmed that she would submit a formal inquiry soon. She was responsive and helpful.

I thought it would take at least a couple of days for anyone from the state government to respond to my official inquiry, but magically, a state government agent called me the next morning to follow up on my inquiry submitted through my assemblymember. I was in a meeting with my coworker, but I paused the meeting in order to take the call; after months of waiting, I finally had a chance to speak with an agent and didn’t want to miss it. It took me less than 10 minutes to explain my situation, have the agent look up my status, and upload supplementary materials. After receiving my materials, the agent said the documents would be sent for review, and I should wait for the next step. I asked her when my case would be resolved after this, and the agent repeated that my documents would be reviewed by someone in charge of this and that she didn’t know the timeline. Hearing that response, I felt frustrated and amused to some degree. The whole conversation happened as if we were in a Kafka novel; the agent's voice was monotonous, and I knew she called me only because of the inquiry from the office of my assemblymember. I ended the call with her and felt glad my livelihood didn’t depend on this.

Most people have dealt with a similarly Kafkaesque bureaucracy when they engage with government services. In the United States, the DMV, social services, and the immigration system are textbook examples of Kafkaesque bureaucracy. Sometimes, Kafkaesque services crawl into the private sector, too; last year I had to submit an official complaint to the CFPB to get support as a consumer. In those moments, I was grateful for regulation and elected officials.

As I jotted down my experience and thoughts, I realized even a single incident can serve as a window to the bigger picture of our society – alienation, bureaucracy, and regulation.

Luckily, my case was resolved within two days after the call with the agent, but I’m sure countless other consumers, taxpayers and customer service agents are still stuck in various Kafkaesque processes. As I work on building a startup in the customer experience space, I truly hope I can bring some improvement to the process and help customers, agents, and organizations.
