## TL;DR

## Introduction
I have spent last 2.5 years on listening to what business wants from GenAI, building GenAI applications and delivering value from the applications. It has been interesting journey for me, since I realized the advent of ChatGPT is a paradigm shift for ML/AI practitioners like me. I started believe GenAI would change our lives like personal computer in 90s or modern search engine in 2000s.

Before I dive into evaluation of GenAI, I want to define a few key terms for this article. These terms are used interchangeable and over-used nowadays, but I found it difficult to discuss any AI related topic without clearly defining the scope of these terms. Please find my definition below:

**Essentially, ML is what we are used to and have been evaluating in last decade, and GenAI and LLM are the new technology we want to evaluate against.** AI is a umbrella term for everythingðŸ™ƒ.
