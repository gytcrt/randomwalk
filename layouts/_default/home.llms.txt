# Random Walk (https://andreagao.com/)

> Welcome to the personal blog of Andrea Gao, a full-stack AI practitioner sharing insights on technology, GenAI, work culture, and life. This blog is a space to document thoughts and ideas as they randomly walk through my mind.

## About author

My name is Andrea Gao (she/her). I am a full-stack AI practitioner.

I am interested in bringing data and ML/AI systems together to solve valuable problems. Over the past two years, I have been particularly focused on developing GenAI use cases and their iterations.

I have worked on every step in modern ML/AI systems, from proof-of-concept to pilot to production, as both an engineer and a leader. I find it thrilling to innovate and change the status quo with cutting-edge or mature technologies.

As I stepped into leadership roles, I found myself a bit rusty in coding in recent years. So I decided to rebuild my personal website to brush up on the latest tools and frameworks. I believe it's important for leaders to stay close to their domain when they guide their team and organization.

This blog covers topics including:
- Artificial Intelligence and GenAI applications
- AI/ML system development and deployment
- Responsible AI and data bias
- Tech industry work culture and startup insights
- Writing and creative pursuits
- Personal essays and reflections
